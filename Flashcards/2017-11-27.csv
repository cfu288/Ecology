Zero population growth isocline|population sizes at which a population experiences zero growth.
Mutualism|Positive interaction between two species in which both species receives benifits
Generalists|a species that interacts with many other species.
Specialists|a species that interacts with one other species or a few closely related species.
Obligate mutualists|two species that provide fitness benefits to each other and require each other to persist.
Facultative mutualists|two species that provide fitness benefits to each other, but the interaction is not critical to the persistence of either species.
Mycorrhizal fungi|fungi that surround plant roots and help plants obtain water and minerals.
Endomycorrhizal fungi|fungi characterized by hyphal threads that extend far out into the soil and penetrate root cells between the cell wall and the cell membrane.
Ectomycorrhizal fungi|fungi characterized by hyphae that surround plant roots and enter between root cells but rarely enter the cells.
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|a type of endomycorrhizal fungi that infects a tremendous number of plants including apple trees, peach trees, coffee trees, and grasses.
endophytic fungi|fungi that live inside a plant’s tissue.
Pollination|Movement of pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part of the flower
Corbicula(e)|places on hind leg where pollen is collected in honey bees and Bumble bees.
Scopa|places on hind leg where pollen is collected in other bees
Ophyrs|dont make nectar, this flower mimics female bee and releases pheremones - pseudocopulation. Not mutualistic.
Carrion flowers|looks and smells like flesh, attacts flies to brood there
Metis|Smells like decay, large plant in bing greenhouse
Buzz pollination|
Flower|sepals(green), petals, stamins(produce pollen at the anther, filament supports it), carpals(Ovules to become fertilized and produce seeds)
10% stamens don't open up|require pollinators to use buzz pollination - causes pollen grains to shoot out. Allows plants to restrict which animals to use their resource. Tomatos
How do flowers encourage animal visitors|visual cures (odor, size),
Convergent evolution of floral traits|trait similarity not due to ancestory, but selective pressures that happen independently.  
What is a parasite?|1. Lives in or on another organism (host), Consumes host resources, Causes harm to host, A pathogen is a type of parasite that causes infectious disease.
Ectoparasites|live on the outside of an organism. Arthopods, leeches, nemtodes
Endoparasites|live inside organisms. Viruses, Prions, Protozoans, bacteria, fungi, Helminths
Intracellular|live inside the cells of a host
Intercellular|live in spaces between cells of a host
Prions|brain proteins that unfold into incorrect shape, affects other proteins they come in contact with. From consumption of infected dead animals or their waste.
Bacteria|single-celled prokaryotes
Fungi|BD is largest killer of amphibians, found in central america
Helminths|roundworms and flatworms. Dose dependent, wont kill unless too much. Prefers for amphibian to be eaten by bird
Emerging infectious disease|a newly discovered or rare disease that increases in abundance. Often occurs when a mutation allows a pathogen to jump to a new host species.
Factors that influence the probability of host infection|Mechanism of transmission, Mode of entering the host, Ability of parasite to jump between species, Existence of reservoir species, Counterattacks to host’s immune system
SIR Model|Look at susceptible <-> infections -> recovered individuals. Not a spacial model.
Communities and boundaries|The zone in which each species grows reflects different tolerance for environmental conditions and the ability to compete.
Communities are often categorized by|their dominant organisms or by physical conditions that affect the distribution of species.
Ecotone|a boundary created by sharp changes in environmental conditions over a relatively short distance, accompanied by a major change in the composition of species.
Interdependent communities|communities in which species depend on each other to exist.
Clements|proposed that most communities are interdependent and act as superorganisms.
Independent communities|communities in which species do not depend on each other to exist.
Gleason|proposed that most communities consist of species with independent distributions.
If species distributions are independent|They should depend only on individual habitat requirements, There should be gradual changes in species along a line transect.
If species are interdependent|Removing a species should cause other species to decline; if changes are neutral or positive species are independent.
Species richness|the number of species in a community. Can be affected by the amount of available resources.
Relative abundance|the proportion of individuals in a community represented by each species.
Rank-abundance curves|a curve that plots the relative abundance of each species in a community in rank order from the most abundant species to the least abundant species. To plot a rank-abundance curve, rank each species in terms of its abundance; the most abundant species receives a rank of 1, the next most abundant species receives a rank of 2, etc.
Species evenness|a comparison of the relative abundance of each species in a community. Flatter slope is more even.
Added resources caused a|decline in species richness of producers. For plant communities, increased fertility may cause dominant plants to cast more shade on competitively inferior plants.
Keystone species|a species that substantially affects the structure of communities, although species might not be particularly numerous.Removal of a keystone species can cause a community to collapse.Ex -starfish eat muscles allowing new species to enter
Ecosystem engineers|are keystones species that affect communities by influencing the structure of a habitat.
Intermediate disturbance hypothesis|the hypothesis that more species are present in a community that experiences occasional disturbances than in a community with either frequent or rare disturbances. Intermediate levels have highest amount of diversity. Forest fires are an example, occasional is good.
Intermediate disturbance hypothesis|the hypothesis that more species are present in a community that experiences occasional disturbances than in a community with either frequent or rare disturbances.
Food Web|complex and realistic representation of how species feed on each other in a community. Arrows in a food web indicate consumption and the movement of energy and nutrients.
Direct effect|an interaction between two species that does not involve other species. The direct effect of one species often sets off a chain of events that affect other species in the community.
Indirect effect|an interaction between two species that involves one or more intermediate species.
