Zero population growth isocline|population sizes at which a population experiences zero growth.
Mutualism|Positive interaction between two species in which both species receives benifits
Generalists|a species that interacts with many other species.
Specialists|a species that interacts with one other species or a few closely related species.
Obligate mutualists|two species that provide fitness benefits to each other and require each other to persist.
Facultative mutualists|two species that provide fitness benefits to each other, but the interaction is not critical to the persistence of either species.
Mycorrhizal fungi|fungi that surround plant roots and help plants obtain water and minerals.
Endomycorrhizal fungi|fungi characterized by hyphal threads that extend far out into the soil and penetrate root cells between the cell wall and the cell membrane.
Ectomycorrhizal fungi|fungi characterized by hyphae that surround plant roots and enter between root cells but rarely enter the cells.
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|a type of endomycorrhizal fungi that infects a tremendous number of plants including apple trees, peach trees, coffee trees, and grasses.
endophytic fungi|fungi that live inside a plant’s tissue.
Pollination|Movement of pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part of the flower
Corbicula(e)|places on hind leg where pollen is collected in honey bees and Bumble bees.
Scopa|places on hind leg where pollen is collected in other bees
Ophyrs|dont make nectar, this flower mimics female bee and releases pheremones - pseudocopulation. Not mutualistic.
Carrion flowers|looks and smells like flesh, attacts flies to brood there
Metis|Smells like decay, large plant in bing greenhouse
Buzz pollination|
Flower|sepals(green), petals, stamins(produce pollen at the anther, filament supports it), carpals(Ovules to become fertilized and produce seeds)
10% stamens don't open up|require pollinators to use buzz pollination - causes pollen grains to shoot out. Allows plants to restrict which animals to use their resource. Tomatos
How do flowers encourage animal visitors|visual cures (odor, size),
Convergent evolution of floral traits|trait similarity not due to ancestory, but selective pressures that happen independently.  
What is a parasite?|1. Lives in or on another organism (host), Consumes host resources, Causes harm to host, A pathogen is a type of parasite that causes infectious disease.
Ectoparasites|live on the outside of an organism. Arthopods, leeches, nemtodes
Endoparasites|live inside organisms. Viruses, Prions, Protozoans, bacteria, fungi, Helminths
Intracellular|live inside the cells of a host
Intercellular|live in spaces between cells of a host
Prions|brain proteins that unfold into incorrect shape, affects other proteins they come in contact with. From consumption of infected dead animals or their waste.
Bacteria|single-celled prokaryotes
Fungi|BD is largest killer of amphibians, found in central america
Helminths|roundworms and flatworms. Dose dependent, wont kill unless too much. Prefers for amphibian to be eaten by bird
Emerging infectious disease|a newly discovered or rare disease that increases in abundance. Often occurs when a mutation allows a pathogen to jump to a new host species.
Factors that influence the probability of host infection|Mechanism of transmission, Mode of entering the host, Ability of parasite to jump between species, Existence of reservoir species, Counterattacks to host’s immune system
SIR Model|Look at susceptible <-> infections -> recovered individuals. Not a spacial model.
