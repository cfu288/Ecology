Matrix potential|potential energy generated by the attractive forces and soil particles,occurs because water molecules and soil particles have electrical charges
Field capacity|Max num of water held by soil in gravity (Normal conditions). Gravity will cause water to drain out of soil. -.01 MPa

Root pressure|Osmotic pressure of the roots of a plant compared to the rest of the soil
Transpiration|process which leaves can generate water potential as water evaporates from the surfaces of leaf cells.
Cohesion-tension theory|Mechanism of water movement in pants from roots to leaves. Osmosis pushes water into roots, gradient of water from high in roots to low in leaves due to transpiration. Water moves naturally because water has high cohesion, which helps it move up the plant.
Stomata|small opening in leaves, controlled by guard cells. Regulates transpiration happens. Points of entry for CO2
Where would you find most stomata on the plants terrestrial vs aquatic|Stomata in terrestrial plants are on bottom of leaves, prevents wilting, on top for aquatic for CO2 letting out water
Electromagnetic radiation|packaged in photons. We see the visible spectrum - 400-700nm (violet to red)

Chlorophyll A|400 to 450 range abs, red and violet absorbed
Caratonoids|Absorbs greens, reflects orange.
Chlorophyll b,c,d,f|accessory pigments that capture light energy and pass to a.
Photosynthesis|6CO2 + 6H2O + photons -> C6H12O6+ 602. Happens in 2 steps, light reactions and Calvin cycle
Light reactions|Chlorophyll in thylakoids absorb photons, releases e to chain of reactions. Splits H20 molecules, forms O2, energy and hydrogen created used to create ATP and NADPH from ADP and NADP+.
Calvin cycle|Takes place in stroma of chloroplast - uses generated ATP and NADPH and takes CO2 to convert to glucose.  **C02 + RuBP -> 2g3p** in a C3 plant.
C4|grasses, sedges. Stressful conditions, must maximize CO2 used
CAM|What makes them different, Crassulaceae plants (HW) watch video
Homeostasis|organisms ability to maintain constant internal conditions
Negative feedback|The action of internal response mechanisms that restores a system to a desired state, or set point, when the system deviates from that state.
Blood shunting|hen specific blood vessels shut off so less of an animal’s warm blood flows to cold extremities where heat would be lost. Shunting occurs at _precapillary sphincters_.
Countercurrent circulation|helps to conserve heat by positioning arteries that carry warm blood away from the heart alongside veins that carry chilled blood from the extremities back to the heart.

Phenotypic trade-off|a situation in which a given phenotype experiences higher fitness in one environment, whereas other phenotypes experience higher fitness in other environments
Phenotypic plasticity|ability of a singe genotype to produce multiple phenotypes, When environmental variation results in phenotypic trade-offs, natural selection will favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity
Environmental cues|For an organism to alter its phenotype in an adaptive way, it must first be able to sense its environmental conditions.
