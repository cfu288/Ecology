Individual|Fundamental unit of ecology. Has a membrane, transforms and moves energy, and alters the condition of the environment.
Species|Capable if interbreeding or share genetic similarity
Hybrids|Results of breeding two different species and the offspring can create viable offspring (Donkey and zebra, lion and tiger)
Individual approach|understand how adaptations allow an organism to survive in its environment
Population|individuals  of the same species living in a particular area
Population approach|Examines variation in the number, density, and composition of individuals
Geographic range|distribution is the extent of th and or water within which a population lives
Abundance|total number of individuals
Density|number per unit area
Composition|number of age, gender, or genetics
Community|Populations of species living together in a particular area.
Community approach|understanding the diversity and interactions of organisms living together in the same place
Ecosystem|One of more communities of living organisms interacting with their nonliving physical and chemical environment
Ecosystem approach|Describes the storage and transfer of energy and matter
Biosphere|All ecosystems on earth combined by wind, water, and movement of organisms.
Biosphere approach|Examines movement of energy and chemicals over the earth's surface.
First law of thermo|Matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, can change form. Ecological systems can gain or lose energy. Organization of community is important. What organisms do with their energy makes them different.
Phenotype|an attribute of an organism (morphology or behavior)
Genotype|the set of genes a organism carries, determines an organisms phenotype.
Natural Selection|changes of genes in a population through differential survival and reproductions of individuals with certain phenotypes
Requirements|individuals very in traits, traits are heritable, variation in traits causes some individuals to experience higher fitness.
Producers|autotrophs - Make their own energy
Consumers|heterotr0phs - obtain energy from other organisms
Mixotrophs|Both produced and consumers (Venus Fly Trap)
Scavangers|Consume dead animals
Detrtivores|Break down dead organic matter
Decomposers|Break down detritus into simpler elements that can be recycled
Competition|When two organisms depend on the same resource and have a neg effect on each other
Mutualism|two species benefit from each other
Commensalism|One benefits, another is not affected
Habitat|Place or physical setting where an organism lives, determined by physical features
Niche|Range of abiotic and biotic condition and organism can tolerate
Proximate hypothesis|addresses the cause of immediate changes in individual phenotypes or interactions (How and What)
Ultimate hypothesis|address the fitness costs and benefits of a response (Evolutionary response (Why))
Manipulative Hypothesis|Where a hypothesis is tested by altering a factor to be the cause of a phenomenon
Treatment|The factor that we want to manipulate in the Study
Experimental unit|object we want to apply manipulation
Replication|being able to reproduce a similar outcome multiple times
Randomization|requirement for manipulation experiments, every experimental unit must have an equal change of being assigned to a particular treatment.
Natural experiments|an approach to hypothesis testing that relies on natural variation in the enviornment to test a hypothesis
Mathematical models|represenations of a system with a set of equations that correspond to hypothesized relationships amons system components
