### Ecology - Study of abundance and distribution of organisms in relation to other organisms and environmental conditions
* _Blue dragon_ - Sea slug that lives in the ocean, found in coastal south Africa. Dorsal is colorful, ventral is white. Allows it to hide in water from above and below predators.

### Ecological systems and how they exist in hierarchical systems
  * **Individual** - Fundamental unit of ecology. Has a membrane, transforms and moves energy, and alters the condition of the environment.
  * **Species** - Capable if interbreeding or share genetic similarity
    * **Hybrids** - Results of breeding two different species and the offspring can create viable offspring (Donkey and zebra, lion and tiger)
    * **Individual approach** - understand how adaptations allow an organism to survive in its environment
  * _Blob fish_ - Lives in deep waters, gelatinous and looks inflated out of deep water. Eats scraps. Does not use swim bladder, stays at same altitude naturally
  * **Population** - individuals  of the same species living in a particular area
    * **Population approach**- Examines variation in the number, density, and composition of individuals
  * **Geographic range** - distribution is the extent of th and or water within which a population lives
  * **Abundance** - total number of individuals
  * **Density** - number per unit area
  * **Composition** - number of age, gender, or genetics
  * **Community** - Populations of species living together in a particular area.
    * Boundaries are not strict
    * **Community approach** - understanding the diversity and interactions of organisms living together in the same place
    * Introducing wolves to Yellowstone -> reduce deer, dec water flow due to inc plantation, inc mice, coyotes driven out. Cascading effect on community.
  * **Ecosystem** - One of more communities of living organisms interacting with their nonliving physical and chemical environment
    * **Ecosystem approach** - Describes the storage and transfer of energy and matter
  * **Biosphere** - All ecosystems on earth combined by wind, water, and movement of organisms.
    * **Biosphere approach** - Examines movement of energy and chemicals over the earth's surface.
* Governing principles of Ecology
  * **First law of thermo** - Matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, can change form. Ecological systems can gain or lose energy. Organization of community is important. What organisms do with their energy makes them different.
  * **Evolution**:
    * **Phenotype** - an attribute of an organism (morphology or behavior)
    * **Genotype** - the set of genes a organism carries, determines an organisms phenotype.
    * **Natural Selection** - changes of genes in a population through differential survival and reproductions of individuals with certain phenotypes
      * **Requirements** - individuals very in traits, traits are heritable, variation in traits causes some individuals to experience higher fitness.

### Different organisms play diverse roles in ecological systems
* Categorize species by energy source
  * **Producers** - autotrophs - Make their own energy
  * **Consumers** - heterotr0phs - obtain energy from other organisms
  * **Mixotrophs** - Both produced and consumers (Venus Fly Trap)
  * _Bladderwort_ - Carnivorous plants, using pressurized traps in stomach
  * **Scavangers** - Consume dead animals
  * **Detrtivores** - Break down dead organic matter
  * **Decomposers** - Break down detritus into simpler elements that can be recycled
  * _Crazy worms_ - eat detritus, but does not leave nutrients behind for decomposers unlike earthworms
* Catagorize by species interactions
  * Predatation -
  * Parasitism -
  * Herbivory -
  * **Competition** - When two organisms depend on the same resource and have a neg effect on each other
  * **Mutualism** - two species benefit from each other
  * **Commensalism** - One benefits, another is not affected
* Categorize by living area
  * **Habitat** - Place or physical setting where an organism lives, determined by physical features
  * **Niche** - Range of abiotic and biotic condition and organism can tolerate

### Several approaches to study Ecology
  * **Proximate hypothesis** - addresses the cause of immediate changes in individual phenotypes or interactions (How and What)
    * Simpler hypothesis, hungry after sex, black widow eats male
  * **Ultimate hypothesis** - address the fitness costs and benefits of a response (Evolutionary response (Why))
    * Better nutrients for eggs, can pass down genes
