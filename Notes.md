# Ecology

### Ecology - Study of abundance and distribution of organisms in relation to other organisms and environmental conditions
* _Blue dragon_ - Sea slug that lives in the ocean, found in coastal south Africa. Dorsal is colorful, ventral is white. Allows it to hide in water from above and below predators.

### Ecological systems and how they exist in hierarchical systems
  * **Individual** - Fundamental unit of ecology. Has a membrane, transforms and moves energy, and alters the condition of the environment.
  * **Species** - Capable if interbreeding or share genetic similarity
    * **Hybrids** - Results of breeding two different species and the offspring can create viable offspring (Donkey and zebra, lion and tiger)
    * **Individual approach** - understand how adaptations allow an organism to survive in its environment
  * _Blob fish_ - Lives in deep waters, gelatinous and looks inflated out of deep water. Eats scraps. Does not use swim bladder, stays at same altitude naturally
  * **Population** - individuals  of the same species living in a particular area
    * **Population approach**- Examines variation in the number, density, and composition of individuals
  * **Geographic range** - distribution is the extent of th and or water within which a population lives
  * **Abundance** - total number of individuals
  * **Density** - number per unit area
  * **Composition** - number of age, gender, or genetics
  * **Community** - Populations of species living together in a particular area.
    * Boundaries are not strict
    * **Community approach** - understanding the diversity and interactions of organisms living together in the same place
    * Introducing wolves to Yellowstone -> reduce deer, dec water flow due to inc plantation, inc mice, coyotes driven out. Cascading effect on community.
  * **Ecosystem** - One of more communities of living organisms interacting with their nonliving physical and chemical environment
    * **Ecosystem approach** - Describes the storage and transfer of energy and matter
  * **Biosphere** - All ecosystems on earth combined by wind, water, and movement of organisms.
    * **Biosphere approach** - Examines movement of energy and chemicals over the earth's surface.
* Governing principles of Ecology
  * **First law of thermo** - Matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, can change form. Ecological systems can gain or lose energy. Organization of community is important. What organisms do with their energy makes them different.
  * **Evolution**:
    * **Phenotype** - an attribute of an organism (morphology or behavior)
    * **Genotype** - the set of genes a organism carries, determines an organisms phenotype.
    * **Natural Selection** - changes of genes in a population through differential survival and reproductions of individuals with certain phenotypes
      * **Requirements** - individuals very in traits, traits are heritable, variation in traits causes some individuals to experience higher fitness.

### Different organisms play diverse roles in ecological systems
* **_Categorize species by energy source_**
  * **Producers** - autotrophs - Make their own energy
  * **Consumers** - heterotr0phs - obtain energy from other organisms
  * **Mixotrophs** - Both produced and consumers (Venus Fly Trap)
  * _Bladderwort_ - Carnivorous plants, using pressurized traps in stomach
  * **Scavangers** - Consume dead animals
  * **Detrtivores** - Break down dead organic matter
  * **Decomposers** - Break down detritus into simpler elements that can be recycled
  * _Crazy worms_ - eat detritus, but does not leave nutrients behind for decomposers unlike earthworms
* **_Categorize by species interactions_**
  * Predatation
  * Parasitism
  * Herbivory
  * **Competition** - When two organisms depend on the same resource and have a neg effect on each other
  * **Mutualism** - two species benefit from each other
  * **Commensalism** - One benefits, another is not affected
* **_Categorize by living area_**
  * **Habitat** - Place or physical setting where an organism lives, determined by physical features
  * **Niche** - Range of abiotic and biotic condition and organism can tolerate

### Several approaches to study Ecology
  * **Proximate hypothesis** - addresses the cause of immediate changes in individual phenotypes or interactions (How and What)
    * Simpler hypothesis, hungry after sex, black widow eats male
  * **Ultimate hypothesis** - address the fitness costs and benefits of a response (Evolutionary response (Why))
    * Better nutrients for eggs, can pass down genes
  * **Manipulative Hypothesis** - Where a hypothesis is tested by altering a factor to be the cause of a phenomenon
  * **Treatment** - The factor that we want to manipulate in the Study
  * **Experimental unit** - object we want to apply manipulation
  * **Replication** - being able to reproduce a similar outcome multiple times
  * **Randomization** - requirement for manipulation experiments, every experimental unit must have an equal change of being assigned to a particular treatment.
  * **Natural experiments** - an approach to hypothesis testing that relies on natural variation in the enviornment to test a hypothesis
  * **Mathematical models** - representations of a system with a set of equations that correspond to hypothesized relationships among system components

### Adaptations to terrestrial environments
  * Nutrients from the soil
    * Plants need O,C,H,N,K, etc, most of which are obtained by ions dissolved in water in soil
  * Soil particles- sand, silt, and clay
    * **Sand** - < .05 mm
    * **Silt** - .002 - .05
    * **Clay** - <.002
  * Soil is often composed of mixtures of particles
  * _Good soil holds more water_ (clay > silt, more surface area). Water binds to ions in clay
  * _Good soil hold water less tightly_ (allows for plants to access water more freely, silt > clay). Less SA
    * Clay is not a great soil

### Soil structure and water
  * **Matrix potential** - potential energy generated by the attractive forces and soil particles,occurs because water molecules and soil particles have electrical charges
  * **Field capacity** - Max num of water held by soil in gravity (Normal conditions). Gravity will cause water to drain out of soil. -.01 MPa
  * **Saturation** - 100% water, 0 MPa
  * **Wilting point** - When water is held too tightly, prevents plant from getting it, higher wilting point. -1.5 MPa
    * Clay has a high field capacity, but also highest wilting point
    * Silt holds a similar amount of water, but has a much lower wilting point

### Cohesion-tension theory:
  * **Cohesion** - Attraction of substance to itself
  * **Root pressure** - Osmotic pressure of the roots of a plant compared to the rest of the soil
  * **Transpiration** - process which leaves can generate water potential as water evaporates from the surfaces of leaf cells.
  * **Cohesion-tension theory** - Mechanism of water movement in pants from roots to leaves. Osmosis pushes water into roots, gradient of water from high in roots to low in leaves due to transpiration. Water moves naturally because water has high cohesion, which helps it move up the plant.

### Photosynthesis:
![Photosynthesis](/Images/photosynthesis.jpg)
  * **Stomata**- small opening in leaves, controlled by guard cells. Regulates transpiration happens. Points of entry for CO2
    * **Where would you find most stomata on the plants terrestrial vs aquatic** - Stomata in terrestrial plants are on bottom of leaves, prevents wilting, on top for aquatic for CO2 letting out water
  * **Electromagnetic radiation** - packaged in photons. We see the visible spectrum - 400-700nm (violet to red)
  * **PAR** - 400 nm (violet) and 700 nm (red) - photosynthetically active region
  * **Chlorophyll A** - 400 to 450 range abs, red and violet absorbed
  * **Caratonoids** - Absorbs greens, reflects orange.
  * **Chlorophyll b,c,d,f** - accessory pigments that capture light energy and pass to a.
  * **Photosynthesis** - 6CO2 + 6H2O + photons -> C6H12O6+ 602. Happens in 2 steps, light reactions and Calvin cycle
  * **Light reactions** - Chlorophyll in thylakoids absorb photons, releases e to chain of reactions. Splits H20 molecules, forms O2, energy and hydrogen created used to create ATP and NADPH from ADP and NADP+.
  * **Calvin cycle** - Takes place in stroma of chloroplast - uses generated ATP and NADPH and takes CO2 to convert to glucose.  **C02 + RuBP -> 2g3p** in a C3 plant.
  (IMAGE here)
  * **C4** - grasses, sedges. Stressful conditions, must maximize CO2 used
  * **CAM** - What makes them different, Crassulaceae plants (HW) watch video
  * **Why does leaf structure differ between c3 and c4 plants?** (HW) watch video

### Homeostasis:
  * **Homeostasis** - organisms ability to maintain constant internal conditions
  * **Negative feedback** - The action of internal response mechanisms that restores a system to a desired state, or set point, when the system deviates from that state.
  * **Blood shunting** - hen specific blood vessels shut off so less of an animal’s warm blood flows to cold extremities where heat would be lost. Shunting occurs at _precapillary sphincters_.
  * **Countercurrent circulation** - helps to conserve heat by positioning arteries that carry warm blood away from the heart alongside veins that carry chilled blood from the extremities back to the heart.
  * _African bullfrog_ - adaptations to lack of water. Leave one male behind to sire tadpoles, even offspring that are not their own.
  * Water and salt balance - important to survive, especially in dry conditions
  * _Thorny devil_ - uses capillary action to drink morning dew on desert sand.
  * **Thermoregulation** - The ability of an organism to control the temp of their body
  * **Homeotherms** - Organisms that maintain constant temperature
  * **Endotherms** - Organisms that can generate metabolic heat
  * **Ectotherms** - Temperatures determined by environment
  * **Poikilotherms** - Organisms that do not have constant body temperatures.
  * **Poikilotherms Homeotherms** - squirrel, hybernation

### Ecosystems
  * Water
    * Water has high specific heat - resistant to temperature change.
    * Water is most dense at 4C, keeps water bodies from freezing.
      * Swim bladder is an adaptation for density
    * High viscosity
      * adaptations - streamlined shapes in fish
    * Dissolve inorganic nutrients
    * **Hyperosmotic** - tissue solute concentrations are higher than surrounding water.
    * **Hyposmotic** - tissue solute concentrations are lower than surrounding water.
    * **Osmoregulation** - mechanisms organisms use to maintain a proper solute balance.
    * Sharks and rays convert ammonia, a by-product of protein digestion, into urea. This raises the osmotic potential of their blood to that of seawater, which balances water movement. They accumulate trimethylamine oxide in blood to protect proteins from the harmful effects of urea.
  * O2 in water
    * **Countercurrent circularion, 02** - adaptation where blood and water flow in opposite directions so that the concentration of O2 in water is always greater than the concentration in blood. (HW)
    * **Pneumatophores**- in mangroves extend above the water to absorb oxygen directly from the air!
    * **Q10 value** - a ratio of a physiological process rate at one temperature to the rate of that process when the temperature is 10°C cooler.
### Adaptations to variable environments
  * **Glycerol and glycoproteins** - chemicals present in some animals (e.g., Arctic cod) that prevent freezing by reducing strength of hydrogen bonds or via supercooling (i.e., coating of ice seeds).
  * **Thermal optima** - the range of temperatures in which an organism best performs.
  * **Isozymes** - different forms of an enzyme that catalyze a reaction. Temperatures that exceed thermal optima can be detrimental
  * **Coral bleaching** - loss of color in corals as a result of the corals expelling their symbiotic algae.
  * Thermal pollution
  * **Glycerol and glycoproteins** - chemicals present in some animals (e.g., Arctic cod) that prevent freezing by reducing strength of hydrogen bonds or via supercooling
  * _Temporal variation_ - some change is predictable, some is not
  * **Weather** - Temporal variation in temperature and precipitation over periods of hours or days.
  * **Climate** - Temporal typical atmospheric conditions that occur through the year, measured over many years.
  * **Large Scale spatial variation** -  be caused by factors such as climate, land topography.
  * **Small scale** - variation is generated by factors such as plant structure or soil.
  * Temporal and spatial variation are linked
    * Then smaller the scale of spatial variation,the shorter the temporal scale of variation.
  * **Phenotype** - an attribute of organisms - behavior,morphology, or physiology. Genes interacting with environments
  * **Phenotypic trade-off** - a situation in which a given phenotype experiences higher fitness in one environment, whereas other phenotypes experience higher fitness in other environments
  * **Phenotypic plasticity** - ability of a singe genotype to produce multiple phenotypes, When environmental variation results in phenotypic trade-offs, natural selection will favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Traits including behavior, growth, development, and reproduction can be plastic.
  * **Environmental cues** - For an organism to alter its phenotype in an adaptive way, it must first be able to sense its environmental conditions.
    * _Gekolepis_ - loses scales upon fear, regrow quickly
    * _Black Kites_ - start forest fires to catch prey using human embers
    * _Lemurs_ - use centipedes secretions to get high, protect themselves from bugs
  * **Acclimation** - which is an environmentally induced change in an individual’s physiology, can also be relatively rapid. Rapid responses are often reversible, whereas slow responses are often irreversible. Tanning.
  * **Adaptations to enemies**:
    * _Virginia pepperweed_ - is eaten by herbivores, the plant develops leaf hairs (i.e., trichomes) and gluocosinolate compounds that make the leaves difficult to consume.
    * _THC in weed_ - used as a defense mechanism due to herbivores
  * **Competition to resources** - variety of phenotypically plastic strategies for high and low competition. ex. digestive morphology.
  * **Hermaphrodites** - individuals that produce both male and female gametes; individuals are able to fertilize their eggs with their own sperm (i.e., they are self-compatible).
    * _Clown fish_ - Main male would become female
  * **Inbreeding depression** - the decrease in fitness caused by matings between close relatives due to offspring inheriting deleterious alleles from both the eggs and the sperm. Because of the cost of inbreeding depression some species wait until self-fertilization becomes the last chance for reproduction.
  * **Microhabitats** - locations within a habitat that differ in environmental conditions from the rest of the habitats
  * **Adaptations to abiotic variables**:
    * **Water availability** - plants root to shoots ratio. Scarce water -> higher roots:shoots ratio
    * **prevent freezing** -  producing antifreeze chemicals that control the formation of ice crystals, burrow
    * **High Salinity** -  change the osmotic potential of body fluids by synthesizing large quantities of organic solutes.
    * **Low O2** - more rapid breathing, an increase in the number of red blood cells, and increased heart rate.
  * **Migration, storage, and dormancy are strategies to survive extreme environmental variation**:
    * **Migration** - seasonal movement of animals from one region to another. Response to changing environmental conditions, such as temperature or food supplies
    * _Red crab_ - migrate after monsoons - gills
    * **Storage** - When resources are limited and migration is not possible, storage of resources can be an adaptive strategy. Fat or food supplies for animals, nutrients and energy in roots for plants
    * **Dormancy** - a condition in which organisms dramatically reduce their metabolic processes
      * **Diapause** - involves a partial or complete physiological shutdown in response to unfavorable conditions; common in insects. *Any time*.
      * **Hibernation** - individuals reduce the energetic costs of being active by lowering heart rate and decreasing body temperatures; common in mammals. *Winter*.
      * **Torpor**: a brief period of dormancy in which individuals reduce activity and body temperature; common in birds and mammals. *Brief period of dormancy*.
        * Research for mars trips
      * **Aestivation** - the shutting down of metabolic processes during the summer in response to hot or dry conditions. Well-known examples include snails, desert tortoises, and crocodiles. *During the summer*
    * _Foraging decisions_ - 4 different responses to food variation in space and time  
      * **Central place foraging** - foraging behavior in which acquired food is brought to a central place (e.g., a nest with young birds). Forages farther from the central place = greater amounts of resources, but logarithmic scale of time spent searching and food found.
      * **Risk-sensitive foraging** - foraging behavior that is influence by the presence of predators.
      * **Optimal diet composition** - A predator should always eat the prey species that provides the highest amount of energy gained per unit time. If the highest energy prey is rare, the animal should include less profitable items in its diet.
        * **Handling time** - the amount of time that a predator takes to consume a captured prey.
      * **Diet mixing** - consume a varied diet because one type of food might not provide all of the necessary nutrients.
    * **Greenhouse effect** -  the process of solar radiation striking Earth, being converted to infrared radiation, and being absorbed and re-emitted by atmospheric gases.
    * **Albedo** - the fraction of solar energy reflected by an object.
    * **Adiabatic cooling** - the cooling effect of reduced pressure on air as it rises higher in the atmosphere and expands.
    * **Adiabatic heating** - the heating effect of increased pressure on air as it sinks toward the surface of Earth and decreases in volume.
    * **Latent heat release** - when water vapor is converted back to liquid, water releases energy in the form of heat and warms air.
    * **Hadley cells** - the two circulation cells of air between the equator and 30 degrees N and 30 degree S latitudes.
    * **Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)** - the area where the two Hadley cells converge and cause large amounts of precipitation.
    * **Coriolis effect** - the deflection of an object’s path due to the rotation of Earth.

### Rewilding - Reintroducing biodiversity
  * Rewilding - funding from goverment might be negative effect on species that are not focused on
    * private funders - increases in biodiverity and ecology
    * More species are positively impacted for less money to just conserve existing species
  * Takes place - great plains in the us
  * Benefits of rewilding - Protect ecological services animals provide and the species themselves
    * Whale trophic cascade - great whale killing caused decline in other fish
    * Trophic cascade - starts at top of food chain and trickles down
  * Ecology of fear- just the presence of predators can affect the behavior of other animals
  * People against rewilding - do humans already replace top predators?
    * those that are dead had their chance
  * Pros:
    * Increasing biodiversity
    * give animals another chance to life
    * Benefit other communities and animals down the chain
  * Cons:
    * Taking away from selective pressures of nature
    * Expensive
    * introducing a small gene group

  * **Founder effect**- when a small number of individuals leave a large population to colonize a new area and bring with them only a small amount of genetic variation.
  * Evolution by selection
    * **Selection** -the process by which certain phenotypes are favored to survive and reproduce over other phenotypes.
    * 3 types
      * **Stabilizing selection** - when individuals with intermediate phenotypes have higher survival and reproductive success than those with extreme phenotypes. Occurs when the environment is relatively unchanging. Generates little evolutionary change.
      * **Disruptive selection** - when individuals with either extreme phenotype experience higher fitness than individuals with an intermediate phenotype. genetic and phenotypic variation increases.
      * **Directional selection** - when individuals with extreme phenotypes experience higher fitness than the average population phenotype.
  * **Microevolution** - the evolution of populations; affected by random processes and selection.
  * **Artificial selection** - Selection in which humans decide which individuals will breed; breeding is done with a preconceived goal for the traits in the population (e.g., dogs, wild mustard).
  * **Natural selection** - favors trait combinations that provide higher fitness to an individual.
  * **How do we get random variation** - Random assortment, recombination, mutations, genetic drift, bottleneck, founders
  * **How do we get non-random variation** - Stabilizing (average genotype is good), disruptive(average genotype is bad), directional(extreme phenotype is best)
  * **Industrial melanism** - a phenomenon in which industrial activities cause habitats to become darker due to pollution; individuals possessing darker phenotypes are favored by selection.
  * **Macroevolution** - evolution at higher levels of organization including species, genera, families, orders, and phyla.
  * **Speciation** - the evolution of new species.
  * **Phylogenetic trees** - hypothesized patterns of relatedness among different groups such as populations, species, or genera; depict which groups evolved from other groups.
