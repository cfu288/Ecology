Missed lecture

* **Zero population growth isocline**- population sizes at which a population experiences zero growth.
  * Species 1 will grow until K2 when alone.
  * otherwise, N1 = K2/b (carrying capacity divided by competition coefficent)
  * k2 = k1/a = equivalent using competition coefficent
  * k1 = k2/b
  * below zero population growth isocline -> below carrying capacity, growing
* **Mutualism** - Positive interaction between two species in which both species receives benifits
* **Generalists** - a species that interacts with many other species.
* **Specialists** - a species that interacts with one other species or a few closely related species.
* **Obligate mutualists**- two species that provide fitness benefits to each other and require each other to persist.
* **Facultative mutualists** - two species that provide fitness benefits to each other, but the interaction is not critical to the persistence of either species.
* **Mycorrhizal fungi** - fungi that surround plant roots and help plants obtain water and minerals.
* **Endomycorrhizal fungi** - fungi characterized by hyphal threads that extend far out into the soil and penetrate root cells between the cell wall and the cell membrane.
* **Ectomycorrhizal fungi** - fungi characterized by hyphae that surround plant roots and enter between root cells but rarely enter the cells.
* Fungal hyphae provide plants with soil minerals (e.g., nitrogen) and water; plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis.
* **Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi** - a type of endomycorrhizal fungi that infects a tremendous number of plants including apple trees, peach trees, coffee trees, and grasses.
* Mutualistic interactions between plants and bacteria convert unusable forms of minerals into forms that plants can use. - Nitrogen to plants from bacteria
* Some plants defend themselves through mutualisms with **endophytic fungi** - fungi that live inside a plant’s tissue.
* Each individual participates in a mutualism to improve its own fitness, not that of its partner.

* Pollination Ecology
  * **Pollination** - Movement of pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part of the flower
  * Obligate flower vistors -
  * Vast majority of bees are solitary - obligate herbivores - only eat plants
  * Wasps eat other insects - carnivores. Unlike bees
  * **Corbicula(e)** - places on hind leg where pollen is collected in honey bees and Bumble bees.
  * **Scopa** - places on hind leg where pollen is collected in other bees
  * Darwins orchid - grows on top of other trees, really long nectar spur, coevolution in bees to adapt
  * **Ophyrs** - dont make nectar, this flower mimics female bee and releases pheremones - pseudocopulation. Not mutualistic.
  * **Carrion flowers** - looks and smells like flesh, attacts flies to brood there
  * **Metis** - Smells like decay, large plant in bing greenhouse
  * Diversification of flowering plants lead to diversification of other pollinators in history
  * 80-90% of wild plant species depend on animals for pollination
  * Pollination allows for plant production, provide critical food source for animals that feed on fruits/plants
  * Biotic pollination - mutualism. Each party is a selfish action - plant gains reproductive sucsess, bees gain food
    * nectar has sugars
    * **Buzz pollination** -
  * **Flower** - sepals(green), petals, stamins(produce pollen at the anther, filament supports it), carpals(Ovules to become fertilized and produce seeds)
    * some plants open up
    * **10% stamens don't open up** - require pollinators to use buzz pollination - causes pollen grains to shoot out. Allows plants to restrict which animals to use their resource. Tomatos
  * Figs- inside filled with tons of single flowers.
  * **How do flowers encourage animal visitors** - visual cures (odor, size),
  * **Convergent evolution of floral traits** - trait similarity not due to ancestory, but selective pressures that happen independently.  
  * Unrelated plants have converged similar properties by shared types of pollination
  * Threats to pollination
    * Honey bees - introduced mites
  * Colony collape disorder - bees abandon - not sure why

### Parasitism
  * **What is a parasite?**- 1. Lives in or on another organism (host), Consumes host resources, Causes harm to host, A pathogen is a type of parasite that causes infectious disease.
  * **Ectoparasites** - live on the outside of an organism. Arthopods, leeches, nemtodes
  * **Endoparasites** - live inside organisms. Viruses, Prions, Protozoans, bacteria, fungi, Helminths
      * **Intracellular**- live inside the cells of a host
      * **Intercellular** - live in spaces between cells of a host
    * **Prions** - brain proteins that unfold into incorrect shape, affects other proteins they come in contact with. From consumption of infected dead animals or their waste.
    * **Bacteria** - single-celled prokaryotes
    * **Fungi** - BD is largest killer of amphibians, found in central america
    * **Helminths** - roundworms and flatworms. Dose dependent, wont kill unless too much. Prefers for amphibian to be eaten by bird
  * **Emerging infectious disease** - a newly discovered or rare disease that increases in abundance. Often occurs when a mutation allows a pathogen to jump to a new host species.
  * **Factors that influence the probability of host infection** - Mechanism of transmission, Mode of entering the host, Ability of parasite to jump between species, Existence of reservoir species, Counterattacks to host’s immune system
  * **SIR Model** - Look at susceptible <-> infections -> recovered individuals. Not a spacial model.
