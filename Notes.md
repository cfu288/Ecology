* **Zero population growth isocline**- population sizes at which a population experiences zero growth.
  * Species 1 will grow until K2 when alone.
  * otherwise, N1 = K2/b (carrying capacity divided by competition coefficent)
  * k2 = k1/a = equivalent using competition coefficent
  * k1 = k2/b
  * below zero population growth isocline -> below carrying capacity, growing
* **Mutualism** - Positive interaction between two species in which both species receives benifits
* **Generalists** - a species that interacts with many other species.
* **Specialists** - a species that interacts with one other species or a few closely related species.
* **Obligate mutualists**- two species that provide fitness benefits to each other and require each other to persist.
* **Facultative mutualists** - two species that provide fitness benefits to each other, but the interaction is not critical to the persistence of either species.
* **Mycorrhizal fungi** - fungi that surround plant roots and help plants obtain water and minerals.
* **Endomycorrhizal fungi** - fungi characterized by hyphal threads that extend far out into the soil and penetrate root cells between the cell wall and the cell membrane.
* **Ectomycorrhizal fungi** - fungi characterized by hyphae that surround plant roots and enter between root cells but rarely enter the cells.
* Fungal hyphae provide plants with soil minerals (e.g., nitrogen) and water; plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis.
* **Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi** - a type of endomycorrhizal fungi that infects a tremendous number of plants including apple trees, peach trees, coffee trees, and grasses.
* Mutualistic interactions between plants and bacteria convert unusable forms of minerals into forms that plants can use. - Nitrogen to plants from bacteria
* Some plants defend themselves through mutualisms with **endophytic fungi** - fungi that live inside a plantâ€™s tissue.
* Each individual participates in a mutualism to improve its own fitness, not that of its partner.
